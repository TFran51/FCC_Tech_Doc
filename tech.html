      <section class="main-section" id="Gaming_PC">
        <header>Gaming PC</header>
        <p>When it comes to having a good gaming PC, you really don't need the tip-top hardware. However, this doesn't mean that getting mid-to-high tier hardware won't help.</p>
        <p>Typically, a good gaming PC will have a very good CPU, an excellent GPU, and at least 8GB of RAM. For instance, in my gaming PC, I have an ASUS z790 Prime for my CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 for my GPU, and about 12GB of RAM.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Stream_PC">
        <header>Stream PC</header>
        <p>Memory and raw computing power are what will really keep your stream up and running best as possible. Since we have our game running on our other PC, an excellent GPU isn't as necessary. When I got my gaming PC, I had plans to scrap and sell my 6-year-old PC. However, I quickly came to realize it was a fully functioning stream PC without me having to drop an extensive amount of money on another new PC.</p>
        <p>Anything as simple as a laptop these days has enough computing power and memory to run a stable streaming platform. So if you have a spare laptop you don't know what to do with, or don't have the budget to go all out on two PCs, then a laptop is a wonderful yet simple option for a secondary stream PC.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Monitors">
        <header>Monitors</header>
        <p>In terms of monitors, I recommend getting a high quality monitor to run from your gaming PC, and whatever secondary monitors you want for additional screens to view programs. I didn't want to spend an ungodly amount of money on a monitor, so I luckily found the right one for me after a long search.</p>
        <p>There are many variables that go into picking a monitor, such as display type, refresh rate, resolution, and cable integration. Without getting too overly technical, my monitor is a Titan Army 27" monitor, IPS display, 180hZ refresh rate, and a resolution of 2560x1440. If you'd like to go further into what those terms mean, check out this link <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/535837/monitor_buying_guide.html">here.</a></p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Mice">
        <header>Mice</header>
        <p>Mice don't have much to do with your stream PC at all, just make sure you have one. With mice meant for your gaming PC, there's a couple of things you have to consider here too. Mice have come a long way from what they once were with the clunky overexaggerated designs. Nowadays, lightweight wireless mice are just as competitively viable as heavier wired mice. At the end of the day, it mostly comes down to preference.</p>
        <p>For my gaming PC, I bought a SteelSeries Rival 650 Wireless Mouse. It gives me the ability to play wired or wireless, as well as adjust the weight of it by adding or taking away small metal weights from inside the mouse.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Keyboards">
        <header>Keyboards</header>
        <p>On to the topic of keyboards, we once again have many variables to look at. These variables include keyboard size, switch types, and output type, but at the end of the day the most important thing to remember is that you'll need one for your gaming PC and one for your stream PC.</p>
        <p>I ordered my gaming keyboard off of a website I had been following for a while, called MassDrop. I got their 65% keyboard, meaning the numpad is not included on the keyboard. This keyboard has brown key switches, which is a perfect combination between speedy key reading and overly noisy switches. That is an oversimplification of key switches, if you'd like to learn more about what the right fit for you is, check this website <a href="https://www.mechanical-keyboard.org/switch-types/">here.</a></p>
        <p>And to wrap this section up, my stream PC keyboard is just some cheap $30 full keyboard off of Amazon.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Microphone">
        <header>Microphone</header>
        <p>Now here's where we start to get a little expensive. When it comes to audio quality and services, I highly advise going for something more professional instead of a gaming brand. Of course there's always the good starting microphones from Blue or HyperX, but if you want top audio quality, I would recommend getting a microphone from RODE or SHURE. I personally own the SHURE MV7 for my microphone.</p>
        <p>Now of course, with a micrphone comes an audio interface. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as plugging your micrphone in to two PCs and it just works. You'll need a thing called a DAC, or a Digital to Analog Coverter. This will allow you to plug your microphone directly into your gaming PC for voice chat activities, while also having it plugged into the DAC which will transmit the sound into the stream PC via USB cable. The purpose of the DAC is to take the digital interpretation of the microphone input, and turn it back into raw (or analog) data for the stream PC to interpret too.</p>
        <p>DACs aren't anything special if you don't need them to be, if you plan on having just one audio input, then all you'll need is a single port DAC like the Behringer U-Phoria UMC22. If you need more ports, then I still recommend Behringer brand as it is fairly pocket-friendly.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Capture_Card">
        <header>Capture Card</header>
        <p>Capture cards are a wonderful thing that'll allow you to transfer your gameplay between PCs. All the capture card is going to do is capture your current game and transport the image to the stream PC. In this sense, it's fairly important to have a nicer capture card so your stream doesn't encounter any skipping or low resolution.</p>
        <p>The go to brand for capture cards is Elgato. Of course there are plenty of other capture card brands and devices, but Elgato has come out with a fairly budgeted but powerful capture card, the HD60 X. Now if you have the budget, I'd recomend getting your capture card integrated into your stream PC, however, external capture cards work all the same.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Cables">
        <header>Cables</header>
        <p>Oh boy, where to start with cables. In order to connect it all, you'll need a few types of cables. Just to list quickly, here's what will be needed to connect it all together:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HDMI/DP Cable</li>
          <li>USB 2.0 Cable</li>
          <li>XLR Cable</li>
          <li>Aux Cable</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Optional">
        <header>Optional</header>
        <p>Any additional pieces you want for your setup could include lighting, a camera, soundproofing, among many other things. It's really up to preference and budget for what you want to have in a stream setup. I hope this was able to give you a closer insight of what to get for a dual PC stream setup, and I wish the best of luck!</p>
